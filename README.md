Usage 
The Student grade calculator grades student marks bettween 0-100 and equates a grade to the mark, a grade between A-E.
The output will be :   
return (`Student marks: ${marks} Grade: ${grade}`);

The speed detector checks the speed of a car and equates it to the speed limit. If the speed exceeds the speed limit that equals a strike hence giving them some strikepoints.
If a driver has several strikes and reaches the maximum strikepoints, the drivers lisence is suspended.
